In this section Iâ€™m going to present the development of a Todo management mobile app using a series of State Management solutions and collect some measurements. In particular for every solution implementation three development processes will be done. First basic functionalities of the app will be implemented the. Then I will measure how much effort/code is required to add other new functionalities. In the last part some optimization will be made to the code in terms of UI renders (and memory consumption).
