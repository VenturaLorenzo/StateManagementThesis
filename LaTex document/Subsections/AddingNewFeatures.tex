\label{par:add_todo_feature_explanation}
 The first subpart of the features addition process aims to add the possibility to create new Todos. This feature will utilize the FloatingActionButton already present in the skeleton of the app in the bottom right corner to push the AddTodoPage. In the AddTodoPage will be possible to compile some TextField widget and use a TextButton to actually create the new todo.
 
 
\paragraph{The Update feature} \mbox{} \\
\label{par:update_todo_feature_explanation}
The second subpart of the features addition process aims to add the possibility to tap on a specific TodoItem to navigate to the UpdateTodoPage where two TextFields and a TextButton button will show. Once inserted a new name and/or a new description for the todo, clicking on the confirm button the UpdateTodoPage route will be popped and the todo will be updated.
