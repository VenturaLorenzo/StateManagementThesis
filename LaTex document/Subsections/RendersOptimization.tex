This part of the development process aims to perform some optimizations in terms of rendering and memory consumption. In particular it refactors the code in order to use the least renders possible and ,in other words, to call the least \textit{build} methods possible. The focus is on the TodoView and TodoItem widgets. The todo TodoView widget should be rendered again only after a structural change in the \textit{filteredTodos} list. A structural change is,indeed,  a mutation of the length of the list or a substitution of its internal elements. Basically, a structural change occurs when a new todo is added or removed from the list or when the filter changes. If the change concerns ,instead, a single todo (e.g. when its internal state is changed using the checkbox or the update feature)it is considered a non-structural change. The main difference is that, a structural change, need to rebuild the entire TodoView ,instead, a non-structural change can rebuild only a subpart (the TodoItem). This because , when a structural change occurs, more than one TodoItem is affected and the most convinient way to mutate them all consistently is to rebuild the entire TodoView widget. Moreover, addind , deleting and substituting a TodoItem (and consequently add/delete/substitute a child to the TodoView tree node) is only possible by the parent widget and not by widgets on the same tree level. A non-structural change ,instead, affects only a specific TodoItem/todo and so is possibile to rebuild the single element only. Those optimizations are not really necessary in this scenario. The implemented application is ,indeed, very simple and do not need this kind of improvements at all. This is just an experiment in order to define which solution performs better at handling optimizations and to give an adjunctive prospective in the final comparison.
