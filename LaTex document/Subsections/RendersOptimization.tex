In this part some optimization for the widget's rendering will be made. In particular the aim of this development process is to use the least renders possible or in other words to call the least \textit{build} execution possible. The focus will be on the TodoView and TodoItems. We want the TodoView to be rendered again only when a structure change in the \textit{filteredTodos} list happends and not when a single TodoItemâ€™s internal aspects change. When Todos are modified through tapping the TodoItem's Checkbox or using the update feature only the corresponding TodoItem should be rendered again leaving the rest of the application the same.
